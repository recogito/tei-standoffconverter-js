        <p rend="h5">John Milton</p>
        <p>THE ARGUMENT</p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">This first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole Subject</hi>, Mans
          disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was plac’t: <hi rend="italic">Then
          touches</hi> the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather <hi rend="italic">Satan</hi>
          in the Serpent; who revolting from God, and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels,
          was by the command of God driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the great Deep. <hi
            rend="italic">Which action past over, the Poem hasts into the midst of things,
          presenting</hi> Satan with his Angels now fallen into Hell, <hi rend="italic">describ’d
          here</hi>, not in the Center (<hi rend="italic">for Heaven and Earth may be suppos’d as
          yet not made, certainly not yet accurst</hi>) but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest
          call’d <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi>: Here <hi rend="italic">Satan</hi> with his Angels
          lying on the burning Lake, thunder-struck and astonisht, after a certain space recovers,
          as from confusion, calls up him who next in Order and Dignity lay by him; they confer of
          thir miserable fall. <hi rend="italic">Satan</hi> awakens all his Legions, who lay till
          then in the same manner confounded; They rise, thir Numbers, array of Battel, thir chief
          Leaders nam’d, according to the Idols known afterwards in <hi rend="italic">Canaan</hi>
          and the Countries adjoyning. To these <hi rend="italic">Satan</hi> directs his Speech,
          comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven, but tells them lastly of a new World and
          new kind of Creature to be created, according to an ancient Prophesie or report in Heaven; <hi
            rend="italic">for that Angels were long before this visible Creation, was the opinion of
          many ancient Fathers</hi>. To find out the truth of this Prophesie, and what to determin
          thereon he refers to a full Councel. What his Associates thence attempt. <hi rend="italic">
          Pandemonium</hi> the Palace of <hi rend="italic">Satan rises</hi>, suddenly built out of
          the Deep: The infernal Peers there sit in Councel.</p>

            <l rend="lineno">Can else inflict, do I repent or change,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind</l>

            <l rend="lineno">That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd</l>
            <l rend="lineno">In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?</l>
            <l rend="lineno">All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">And study of revenge, immortal hate,</l>

            <l rend="lineno">And what is else not to be overcome?</l>
            <l rend="lineno">That Glory never shall his wrath or might</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace</l>
            <l rend="lineno">With suppliant knee, and deifie his power,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Who from the terrour of this Arm so late</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">That were an ignominy and shame beneath</l>
            <l rend="lineno">This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods</l>
            <l rend="lineno">And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Since through experience of this great event</l>
            <l rend="lineno">In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">We may with more successful hope resolve</l>
            <l rend="lineno">To wage by force or guile eternal Warr</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.</l>
            <l rend="lineno indent2">So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:</l>

            <l rend="lineno">Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;</l>
            <l rend="lineno">And put to proof his high Supremacy,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Too well I see and rue the dire event,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">That with sad overthrow and foul defeat</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host</l>
            <l rend="lineno">In horrible destruction laid thus low,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Invincible, and vigour soon returns,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Though all our Glory extinct and happy state</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Here swallow'd up in endless misery.</l>
            <l rend="lineno">But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Of force believe Almighty, since no less</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Have left us this our spirit and strength intire</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Strongly to suffer and support our pains,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Or do him mightier service as his thralls</l>
            <l rend="lineno">By right of Warr, what e're his business be</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;</l>
            <l rend="lineno">What can it then avail though yet we feel</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Strength undiminisht, or eternal being</l>
            <l rend="lineno">To undergo eternal punishment?</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.</l>
            <l rend="lineno indent2">Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">To do ought good never will be our task,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">But ever to do ill our sole delight,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">As being the contrary to his high will</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Whom we resist. If then his Providence</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Our labour must be to pervert that end,</l>
            <l rend="lineno">And out of good still to find means of evil;</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb</l>
            <l rend="lineno">His inmost counsels from thir destind aim.</l>
            <l rend="lineno">But see the angry Victor hath recall'd</l>
            <l rend="lineno">His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid</l>

            <l rend="lineno">Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</l>
            <l rend="lineno">To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.</l>
            <l rend="lineno">Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,</l>
